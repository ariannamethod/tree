"""Learning tendrils for the tree engine.

This module performs asynchronous persistence of search windows.  Instead of
spawning a new thread for every :func:`learn` call, tasks are queued and
consumed by a small pool of worker threads.  This keeps the number of threads
bounded while still avoiding blocking the caller.
